AI Use:

There was varied use of OpenAI. I developed this through a blend of documentation from django and the django rest framework, StackOverflow, and OpenAI. I attempted every part by hand (AKA working with the documentation) before working from outside sources (StackOverflow, AI). I do not have the logs, as I used incognito tabs to continue using the 4o model whenver I was working with it. However, I can speak to what I used it for - mainly troubleshooting. There were various issues with authentications/permissions, which is mainly what I used it for. I also used it to help with the JavaScript, as I tried to use forms at first and ran into... an inordinate amount of errors (namely POST 403). There was also some suggestions for bookings/urls and making sure the routers were correctly setting up the urls.
